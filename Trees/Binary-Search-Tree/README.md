Here are the different types of binary trees: 
- **Full binary tree**: Every node other than leaf nodes has 2 child nodes.
- **Complete binary tree**: All levels are filled except possibly the last one, and all nodes are filled in as far left as possible.
- **Perfect binary tree**: All nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
 
 
 For flat arrays, searching for, inserting, and deleting data will loop through every single element, yielding an average efficiency of O(n). With a Binary Search Tree, each step down the tree cuts the remaining nodes to search by up to half. For this reason, search on a BST is performed in O(log(n)) time on average. This is a significant improvement, especially for large data sets.
